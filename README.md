# Multiple-PDF-Vertical-Viewpager

Multiple Pdfs with vertical viewpager , where each fragment in the viewpager is a single page pdf source with 
pinch zoom and double tap zoom gestures  


So here is a project which takes single page pdf files as input and converts it into a view which feels like single pdf file ,
with multiple pages 

here i am using a vertical view pager and android-pdfview (https://github.com/JoanZapata/android-pdfview) to achieve this
but well, i have modified android-pdfview with some extra methods and a bit of changes to serve my purpose
